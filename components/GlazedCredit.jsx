/**
 * The studio credit for a client footer. Drop-in, self-contained, one file.
 *
 * FIVE DECISIONS IN HERE, AND EACH ONE IS A THING THAT GOES WRONG IF YOU DO THE OBVIOUS.
 *
 * 1. MONOCHROME, VIA `currentColor`. The real glazedweb mark is a pink donut with a green
 *    glaze drip, and dropped into a client's footer that is a foreign brand element sitting
 *    in their palette — Glazed pink at 14px in Chism's cream-on-barn-green bottom bar, or
 *    beside MI Gas's ember, reads as something that got pasted in. A single-colour glyph
 *    inheriting the footer's own text colour reads as a signature instead, which is what a
 *    credit is. The full-colour mark belongs on glazedweb.com, where it is the brand rather
 *    than a maker's mark.
 *
 * 2. NO SVG IDs, AND NOTHING TO IMPORT. glazedweb's `Mark` renders `<use href="#mark">` and
 *    needs `LogoDefs()` mounted somewhere, which brings a whole id namespace — `#mark`,
 *    `#pinkGrad`, `#lgGrad`, `#dripEdge` — into a repo that knows nothing about it. Two
 *    problems: it is two components to keep in sync instead of one, and duplicate SVG ids are
 *    undefined behaviour if the client site happens to use any of the same names. That
 *    collision class already cost this project a day — see the note in Sun.tsx about a filter
 *    id shared between two instances painting a dark square on the page. This draws its own
 *    paths inline and references nothing.
 *
 * 3. THE DRIP MOVES ON HOVER ONLY. A footer is the last thing before somebody leaves, and on
 *    Chism it holds the "Get in touch" button. An animated object down there competes with the
 *    one action on the page that matters, forever, on every page. On hover it rewards the
 *    person who noticed and costs nothing for everyone else. Under reduced motion the resting
 *    state is unchanged and the hover simply snaps rather than eases — there is no autoplay to
 *    suppress, which is the easiest kind of motion to make accessible.
 *
 * 4. DRAWN FOR 24px, NOT SCALED DOWN FROM A POSTER. The first version was the poster silhouette
 *    shrunk, and at footer size it read as a pin or a balloon: most of the height was drip, the
 *    hole closed up to four pixels, and the three drips were a pixel wide each. Rendering it at
 *    16 / 19 / 24 / 30 / 40 / 56px in a row is what showed it. Redrawn, the ring takes far more
 *    of the box, the hole is proportionally much larger than on the full mark, and there are two
 *    fatter drips instead of three thin ones. It reads as a dripping donut from 19px up. This is
 *    ordinary favicon practice and the lesson generalises: a mark for 24px is a different drawing
 *    from the same mark at 240px.
 *
 * 5. THE LINE IS A PROP WITH A PLAIN DEFAULT. "Double dipped by Glazed Web" is the studio's
 *    voice and it fits a family farm or a bakery. It does not fit a facility director selling
 *    SOPs to licensed commercial operators, where a donut joke in the footer reads as the
 *    studio talking about itself while the visitor is mid-decision. Pick per client; do not
 *    make the joke the default.
 *
 * REMOVING IT is deleting one line from the footer. Worth being able to say that to a client,
 * and worth actually asking them — a credit in someone else's footer is theirs to decline, and
 * it belongs in the contract rather than in a surprise.
 *
 * ON THE LINK: leave it followed. A designer credit is a genuine editorial link, and the anchor
 * text stays "Glazed Web" rather than anything keyword-shaped — a sitewide footer link with
 * "website design in Marshall Michigan" as its anchor is the version that looks like a scheme.
